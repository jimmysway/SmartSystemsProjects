# Code Readme

Voter Booth: We developed firmware for an ESP32 microcontroller to create a versatile IoT device with network connectivity and user interaction features. We set up MQTT communication for data exchange and implemented GPIO functionality for real-time interactions with buttons and LEDs. An alphanumeric display was programmed using I2C communication for direct user feedback, while UART configuration enabled serial communication with other hardware. Employing FreeRTOS, we efficiently managed multiple concurrent tasks, including MQTT communication, input processing, and display updates, making our device capable of handling a wide range of IoT applications.

Voter Fob: We developed an ESP32-based firmware focused on IR and UART communication for IoT applications. The firmware handles data transmission and reception, including device ID and color information, using UART and a 38kHz IR signal generated by PWM. We included user interaction elements, such as a button to change the device ID and LEDs for visual feedback, simulating a traffic light system. The firmware also features Wi-Fi connectivity, supporting UDP server and client tasks for network communication. By leveraging FreeRTOS, we efficiently managed concurrent tasks for data transmission, LED control, button handling, and network operations. This integration of communication protocols, user interface, and network connectivity makes our system ideal for applications like smart traffic management.

mqtt5.js: We developed a Node.js application that integrates MQTT communication with a web server and WebSocket interface. We utilized several modules, including 'mqtt' for handling MQTT messages, 'fs' and 'csv-parser' for file operations, and 'express' along with 'socket.io' for web server and real-time client communication. Our server listens on port 3000, serving static files and providing a WebSocket connection to clients. It monitors changes in a 'votes.csv' file, emitting updates to connected clients via WebSockets. For MQTT communication, our application connects to a broker, subscribes to a topic, and processes incoming messages to update the CSV file with vote counts. After processing, it publishes a response message to another MQTT topic. This setup allows us to receive vote data via MQTT, update a file accordingly, and relay this information in real-time to a web interface, making it ideal for applications like live voting systems or data monitoring platforms.
