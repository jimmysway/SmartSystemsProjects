### Summary
Our rover buggy is a robust platform for autonomous driving that makes the round trip between a spaceship and the hot springs of Venus. We implemented (1) "cruise control" (or maintaining a constant velocity under perturbations), (2) "turn-around" (reversing the direction of the vehicle), and (3) "collision avoidance" by detecting obstructions and driving around them.

The approach involved (a) attaching sensors and the ESP to your vehicle, (b) enabling control using feedback from the wheel speed sensor to maintain a speed setpoint (driving the vehicle motor), (c) using range sensors to detect and avoid objects, and (d) maintaining forward progress towards each waypoint (A and B)

The key features involved:
- Successfully makes A--B--A trip in reasonable time window
- No collisions with obstructions
- Start and stop instructions should be issued wirelessly through wireless control
- Can use automatic or manual control at turnaround (you can implement a turning algorithm or do this with remote control of steering)
- Displays elapsed time on alpha display
- Constant speed except when doing turns or collision avoidance

#### Main Components
We incorporated various functionalities to control a buggy with ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors for wall avoidance. Here's an overview of how the different parts of the code work together:

1) Wi-Fi Setup: The buggy connects to a Wi-Fi network using the specified SSID and password. This enables the ESP32 to communicate over the network, such as receiving commands via UDP.

2) UDP Server: It listens for incoming UDP packets on a specific port (UDP_PORT). This is used to receive commands from an external source, like a web interface or another networked device.

3) LiDAR Sensor: Configured for distance measurement, it continuously polls the LiDAR sensor to calculate distances. If the distance to an obstacle (like a wall) is less than a threshold (80 units in this case), it triggers a response (stops the buggy).

4) Ultrasonic Sensors: Both left and right ultrasonic sensors are set up to measure distances independently. They use echo callbacks to calculate the time-of-flight and, consequently, the distance.

5) Servo and Speed Control: The code controls a servo for steering and a motor for speed. It uses a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to maintain a target speed and adjusts the steering based on the readings from ultrasonic sensors. We used a 'left dominant'/'right dominant' system whereby the sensor that was closer to the wall would dictate the target distance the buggy was to ride alongside that wall. If the sensor that wasn't closest read a distance that was greater than a predetermined value the code would simply assign a large number to allow the dominant sensor protocol to function.


6) Alphanumeric Display: An I2C-based alphanumeric display is used, possibly for showing status information or measurements.

7) Encoder for Wheel Speed: An encoder is implemented to calculate the wheel's rotation speed, which helps in speed regulation.

#### Code Overview:
Upon startup, the ESP32 initializes its Wi-Fi connection and starts the UDP server to listen for commands.
The LiDAR sensor continuously measures the distance in front of the buggy. If an obstacle is detected within a predefined range, the buggy stops or takes necessary action.
The ultrasonic sensors on both sides assist in navigating by constantly measuring the side distances. The steer_task uses these measurements to adjust the buggy's direction.
Speed is regulated based on encoder readings, and the servo motor adjusts the steering angle as per the PID controller's output.
Commands received via the UDP server (start, stop, turn) control the buggy's movements, allowing remote operation.
The alphanumeric display can show relevant information like speed, distance, or elapsed time.

#### Execution Flow:
Initialization: Wi-Fi and peripherals (like I2C, LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors) are initialized.
Task Creation: Multiple FreeRTOS tasks are created for handling different components (LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, steering, speed control, display).
Operation: The buggy operates based on sensor inputs and received UDP commands. The LiDAR and ultrasonic sensors play a key role in avoiding obstacles, while the servo and motor are controlled to navigate and maintain speed.

#### UDP Commands and Responses:
When the UDP server receives a stop command, it activates an emergency brake (e_brake). The start command deactivates the emergency brake. The turn command initiates a 360-degree turn maneuver. This ESP32-based system showcases a sophisticated approach to robotic control, integrating various sensors and communication protocols for efficient and responsive operation.

1) Startup Instructions: To start server, we can cd into the Website folder and run "node server.js" in console. The site interface can then seen on http://localhost:3000/. One must remember to npm install express and node-fetch and ESP32 device needs to have a UDP server listening on port 8080 to receive messages "start", "stop", "turn".

2) Destination IP Address (ESP32_SERVER_IP): The messages are sent to the IP address specified by ESP32_SERVER_IP, which in your case is set to 'group7.ddns.net'. This is the dynamic DNS (DDNS) address that should resolve to the IP address of your network where the ESP32 device is located.

3) Destination UDP Port (ESP32_UDP_PORT): The messages are sent to the port number specified by ESP32_UDP_PORT, which is 8080 in your code. This means that your ESP32 device needs to have a UDP server listening on port 8080 to receive these messages.

4) Handling in the ESP32: The ESP32 should be programmed to run a UDP server that listens on the specified port (8080). When it receives a message on this port, it should interpret and act upon the message accordingly.

5) Process Flow: When a user interacts with the buttons on the web interface served from the public directory, an HTTP POST request is sent to the /control endpoint on your Node.js server.
The server then extracts the command from the request body (req.body.command). This command is converted to a string (String(req.body.command)) and sent as a UDP message to the ESP32 device at the specified DDNS address and port.

##### Network Configuration:
For the ESP32 to receive these messages, it must be connected to a network that is accessible via the group7.ddns.net address.
If the ESP32 is behind a router (which is usually the case), you'll need to set up port forwarding on your router to forward UDP traffic on port 8080 to the internal IP address of the ESP32 device.

##### Security Considerations:
Since your server sends commands to an ESP32 device over the internet, it's crucial to consider security implications, especially if the commands control a physical device.
Make sure to secure the communication and possibly authenticate the requests to prevent unauthorized access or control.
